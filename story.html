<pre>
  <p>Once in a far away place lived a man who had faith in god.One night,a man was sleeping soundly.
suddently a huge sound woke him up.When he opened his eyes,he saw
 that his room was filled with light.
<p>Just then God appeared before him,showed him a large rock
 outside his house and told him to push that rock
 with all his might.
  <p>Next morning when man woke up,he remembered what he saw that
 night.He got outside and pushed it with all his might but
 wasn't able to move it.Despire it man didnt'nt give up and 
from that day he made his routine to push that rock
 daily with all his might.
  <p style="color:black">For many years he toied from sun up to sun down,his shoulders
 set squarely against the cold,massive surface of that large 
rock,pushing with all of his might.
<p style="color:black">Each night the man returned to his cabin sore and
 worn out,feeling that his whole day had been spent in
 vain as that rock never moved a bit even after many years.
<p style="color:black">Not seeing any progress,man started to get discourage
 and just then devil showed up in his dream and said,
"You have been pushing that rock for long time but
 it hasn't moved..Why to go through all that pain?
it's impossible to move that rock that's Why its 
better to leave it at this and live easy life.."
<p>Saying this devil disappeared.
<p style="color:black">Man was disheartened but still he decided to pray
 to God and tell him about his troubled thoughts.
<p style="color:black">He prayed,"I have labored long and hard in your 
service,putting up all my strength for what you have 
asked me to do and yet after all this time.
<p style="color:black">I have not even budged that rock by millimeter..
 What am i doing Wrong??Why am i feeling?"
<p style="color:black">Just than god apperred and said,"My child,
i asked you to serve me and you accepted it.
I told you to push that rock but never said that
 I expected you to move it..!!
<p style="color:black">Your task was to push and After all these your
 you think you have failed but is it really so??
<p style="color:black">Look at yourself,Your arms are strong and muscled,
your back sinewy and brown,Your hands are callused from 
constant pressure,your legs have become massive and hard.
<p>Facing opposition you have grown and your abilities
 now surpass that you ued to have.
<p>You haven't moved the rock But your calling was
 to be Obedient and to push and to
 Exercise your Faith and Trust in My wisdom.
This you have done."</p>
<h2>MORAL:</h2>
<p> At times when we Face difficulties in Life,
we should just Trust in God and Push.By
all means,exercise the faith that moves 
mountains but know that is still God who moves mountains.</P>
